          <p>I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless
          midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can
          never become a reality.  I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will
          have the final word.</p>
          <p>Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable... Every step toward the goal of
          justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and
          passionate concern of dedicated individuals.</p>

          <p>Another way that you love your enemy is this: When the opportunity presents itself
          for you to defeat your enemy, that is the time which you must not do it.
          There will come a time, in many instances, when the person who hates you most,
          the person who has misused you most, the person who has gossiped about you most,
          the person who has spread false rumors about you most,
          there will come a time when you will have an opportunity to defeat that person.
          It might be in terms of a recommendation for a job; it might be in terms of helping that
          person to make some move in life. Thatâ€™s the time you must do it. That is the meaning of
          love.</p>

          <p>In Flanders Fields the poppies blow between the crosses, row on row, that mark
            our place; and in the sky the larks, still bravely singing, fly scarce heard
            amid the guns below.  We are the Dead, short days ago we lived, felt dawn, saw
            sunset glow, loved and were loved, and now we lie in Flanders Fields.
          </p>
          <p>Take up your quarrel with the foe; to you from failing hands we throw
            the torch; be yours to hold it high, if ye break faith with us who die
            we shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders Fields.
